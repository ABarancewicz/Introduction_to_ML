# Exercise 3: Basic Machine Learning

## Summary
In this exercise you will:
1. Learn how to one-hot encode protein sequences
2. Learn how to use:
\
  a. k-nearest neighbours
\
  b. Random forests
\
  c. Support vector machines
\
  d. Guassian process
\
In this project we will be trying to model the nascent transcription rate of yeast genes based on the data from [this study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2982843/)

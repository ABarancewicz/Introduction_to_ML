# Exercise 3: Basic Machine Learning

## Summary
In this exercise you will:
1. Retrieve relevant protein sequences from UniProt
2. One-hot encode protein sequences
3. Reduce dimensionality with PCA, TSNE, and T

In this project we will be trying to model the nascent transcription rate of yeast genes based on the data from [this study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2982843/)

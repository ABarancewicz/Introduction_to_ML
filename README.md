## About this guide
This guide is made as an introduction to using modern machine learning tools in protein engineering applications. It consists of 
this readme.md which contains a brief summary of various aspects of ML as well as links to more in-depth resources, and various 
exercises to teach how to actually run experiments.
The exercises are:
1. Basic git and BASH - working in github repositories and running/editing scripts
2. Debbuging python - using vscode debugger to analyse what scripts are doing
3. Fundamental ML - One-hot encoding protein data and analysing with basic regression methods
4. ESM and data extraction - Extracting relevant information from a csv file, encoding with ESM, and analysing with basic regression
5. Neural networks - Analysing a protein dataset with a basic neural network
6. Transformers - Training a transformer to encode proteins into vectors
